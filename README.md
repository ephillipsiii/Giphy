# Giphy
A tool that allows users to get up to 10 gifs based on their favorite video game (or any other category!)  Users simply enter in a game (or any other thing they want gifs of!) and a button is created.  Upon clicking the created button, 10 gifs will be presented, which the user can start or stop by clicking on them.  Take a look [here](git@github.com:ephillipsiii/FriendFinder.git).
